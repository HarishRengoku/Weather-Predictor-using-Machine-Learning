# Weather-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning
This is a done by me during my BCA final year. It is a weather predictor done by using python and uses Ridge regression as the Machine Learning Model to perform it.

The data is obtained to train my model is from NOAA(North Oceanic Atmospheric Administration) so, it is 100% accurate and real data.
This project can make graphs, provide predictions and also provide recommendations on what to be done in a place depending on the weather.

I made this project using Python and Pychram as its IDE.
